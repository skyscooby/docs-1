# What is Swift?

Swift is a high-performance system programming language. It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.

To learn more about the programming language, visit [swift.org](https://swift.org).

# How to use this image

##### Start a REPL

Swift requires [a little bit of extra security privilege](https://github.com/apple/swift-docker/issues/9#issuecomment-272527182) to run the REPL. The following command creates an ephemeral container, attaches your terminal to it and starts the Swift REPL. A great way to try out pre-release builds!

```bash
docker run --cap-add sys_ptrace -it --rm winamd64/swift swift
```

##### Pull the Docker Image From Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull winamd64/swift
```

##### Create a Container from the Image and Attach It:

```bash
docker run  -it --name swiftfun winamd64/swift /bin/bash
```

##### To Start and Attach Your Image Later:

Start your image with name `swiftfun`

```bash
docker start swiftfun
```

and then attach it

```bash
docker attach swiftfun
```

# Image Variants

The `winamd64/swift` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `winamd64/swift:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `winamd64/swift:<version>-windowsservercore`

This image is based on [Windows Server Core (`microsoft/windowsservercore`)](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/). As such, it only works in places which that image does, such as Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise (Anniversary Edition) or Windows Server 2016.
